As I mentioned in [Product Management is a Problem Solving Function](../../what-is-pm/my-definitions/problem-solving-function), the job of the PM is to solve problems. While you can build solutions to internal or process problems, you should generally avoid ideating on problems your consumers or product has.

I have personally made the mistake of attempting to solve the problem, but as a PM I am neither the Architect nor the Solutions Engineer. It is their job to come up with the solution. The Product Manager's job is to list and prioritize problems.

## The Catch!

As with everything, there is a catch. If you have more experience than your team in the problem domain, you need to step up and drive the ideation in the right direction. Raise the bar for your team, or help them level up as you do so.
