description: How to prioritize as a Product Manager
---

One of the most critical role a Product Manager has is that of documenting priority of features & tasks. Why just document & not prioritize? Because priority in many cases comes from external factors. Your Senior Leadership Team (STL), a large customer, a large shift in the market, a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GCR) issue. This is one of the reasons I give lesser weightage to Prioritization modes and Frameworks like <a target="_blank" href="https://roadmunk.com/guides/product-prioritization-techniques-product-managers/">RICE, ICE</a> etc. They are good to know, and good ways to document priority, but at times you will end up building something lower down the stack.

Documenting priority makes it easiser to showcase to all your stakeholders what is at stake.

Prioritizing features is also driven by that strategy your organization has taken for the quarter or year. If your CEO has anounced a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/" target="_blank">"Year of Efficiency"</a> all your features will have their priorities reordered.

## Building Segments

One critical element to document priority is to take segment your features by key inititatives your organization or you would like to take up. Anything outside that automatically falls lower in the stack. This simplifies communictaion of prioritiy.

A few good ways to segment your features in via documented by the 2 articles listed below. 

Tom Tunguz <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/why-your-startup-doesnt-invest-enough-in-differentiators/" target="_blank">wrote a post</a> which basically split product features into 3: 

- MMRs (minimum market requirements)
- Differentiators
- Neutralisers

In Addition Adam Nash <a href="https://adamnash.blog/2009/07/22/guide-to-product-planning-three-feature-buckets" target="_blank">suggestes</a> breaking products into the following buckets: 

- Metrics Movers
- Customer Requests
- Customer Delight
