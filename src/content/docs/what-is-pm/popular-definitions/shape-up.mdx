This is one of my favourite definitions of Product Management by Ryan Singer, formerly of BaseCamp, the makers of Hey & Basecamp.

- Sync the people
- Shape the product
- Ship the product

But, Product Management does not end at shipping, you need to support & educate your users.

> Cons to be articulated in the near future
