A I mentioned in [Product Management is a Problem Solving Function](../../what-is-pm/my-definitions/problem-solving-function) the job of the PM is to solve problems. While you can build solutions to internal or process problems, you should never ideate on problems your consumers or product has.

I have personally done the mistake of attempting to solve the problem, but as a PM I am neither the Architect or the Solutions Engineer. It is their job to come up with the solution. The Product Managers jobs is to list and prioritize problems.

> To be articulated in the near future
