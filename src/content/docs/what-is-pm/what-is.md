Defining What product Management is in itself very hard, and I don't have a concrete answer. For a long time, I have been trying to put a definition which I like next to Product Management. But I realized, I will never get to it because it is different things at different places and time. Which is why we hear of *zero to one pms*, *growth pms*, *process pms*, Technical PMs etc. What I have instead, are multiple answers, all of which sound right.

1. [The "Right X" perspective](./my-definitions/right-x)
2. [Value Driver](./my-definitions/value-driver)
3. [Problem Solving Function](./my-definitions/problem-solving-function)

Then there are definition given by vetrans of the Industry
