Defining What product Management is in itself very hard, and I don't have a concrete answer. For a long time, I have been trying to put a definition which I like next to Product Management. But I realized, I will never get to it because it is different things at different places and time. Which is why we hear of *zero to one pms*, *growth pms*, *process pms*, Technical PMs etc. What I have instead, are multiple answers, all of which sound right.

1. [The "Right X" perspective](/what-is-pm/my-definitions/right-x/)
2. [Value Driver](/what-is-pm/my-definitions/right-x/)
3. [Problem Solving Function](/what-is-pm/my-definitions/problem-solving-function/)
4. The job of the PM is to solve any and every problem that stands between the creater of the product and the consumer

Then there are definition given by vetrans of the Industry
