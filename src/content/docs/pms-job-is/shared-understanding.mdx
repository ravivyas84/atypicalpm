One of the first jobs of a PM is to build a shared understanding.

Shared understanding, is when everyone on your team knows why they are building what ever they are building. Everyone needs to know the problem the user is facing, the solution they are building. 

At an organization level, shared understanding is communicated via tools like product road maps, product demos or even Memos

At a Product and Engineering level is is built via Stories and documents that provide all the context for developers and designers. Sometimes these are PRDs, but they can be anything from bullet points to videos. There is no perfect format that can be used across companies. The job is to share as much as possible and make sure all the information is consumed. The medium is not as important as getting the message across.
