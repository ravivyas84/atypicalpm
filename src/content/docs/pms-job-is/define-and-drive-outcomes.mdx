## What Are Outcomes?

An outcome represents the measurable impact or change that a product creates for its consumers. It goes beyond delivering features (outputs) and focuses on whether those features achieve the desired result for your customers and your business.

For example:
Outcome: Increasing conversion rates and basket size.
Output: A newly designed checkout page.

Outcomes are about the value delivered, not the work done. They reflect whether the product solves the intended problem & meets user needs

## Why Outcomes Matter

**They help in driving impact**

The ultimate goal of a product manager is to solve real problems and deliver customer and business value via a Product. 

Focusing on outcomes ensures that a feature being built drives impact across all your consumers rather than a few, and it allows you to say "No" to features that seem exciting to build, but don't push any metrics 

**Team Alignment**

Outcomes act as a north star for your team. When everyone understands the desired impact, it becomes easier to:

- Align priorities
- Avoid feature bloat and unnecessary complexity.

By defining clear outcomes, your team is unified in pursuing the same vision, fostering better communication and decision-making.

**Drives Product Thinking**

Outcomes encourage product managers to think strategically and holistically. Instead of asking, "What should we build next?" you adopt a mindset of:

- "What problem are we solving?"
- "What change do we want to see in user behavior?"
- "How will we measure success?"

This mindset helps you avoid the trap of feature factories and keeps the focus on delivering value.
