What separates Good PMs from rest of the pack is their frequency of customer interviews. 

## How to Talk to your Consumers?

Talk to customers like a Journalist or a biographer. There should be no presumptions made about the user, not should the conversation be led by you. Your goal is to understand the daily life and challenges of your users.
