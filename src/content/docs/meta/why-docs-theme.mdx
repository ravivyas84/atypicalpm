TLDR: Because as a PM, you need to know how to self learn, in many cases by reading docs. 

## Never stop learning, Learn to read docs

Product Management is a function where learning never stops. You need to grow as a PM as you grow and your company Grows.

If you are growing, you need to learn how to manager other PMs and how to articulate your product or company's mission vision and strategy, if your company is growing.

In fact I have a theory, that PMs need to be able to learn 80% of something new in under 6 months, so that they can function effectively.

## Being a Product Manager is learning and unlearning.

The content on this site will never be perfect, like an documentation they will be regularly updated.

## Whats with the "More to be elaborated in the near future"

This is early days for the site, and most of the context is still being written. Rather than wait for it to be perfect, the content is just put out there.
