## It starts from a question

> Question: What course do I need to do to become a Product manager

To which, no offense to anyone providing or taking a course, my response is:

> You can't learn Product manager from courses

Have you ever come across a course for becoming a CEO or COO? I haven't. Both being a CEO and being a PM have a lot in common, starting with the lack of structure.

As an extension, most product managers learn from books which don't talk about Product Management.

I ([who?](/about/me)) got into product management, by doing Product Management before I got the job title of a Product Manager, and to be frank, after more than a decade of being a product Manager, I can articulate a global definition of Product Management

## What is Product management?

Defining Product Management is very hard, with no concrete answer.

What I have are multiple answers, all of which sound right. You can read about [here](/what-is-pm/what-is)

## What is this site trying to do?

The site documents my learnings and collates other key resources so that anyone can self-learn and become a Product Manager.

It won't do courses & certifications! They are the wrong incentives.
