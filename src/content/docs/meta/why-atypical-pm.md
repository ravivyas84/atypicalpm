I came to Product Management with a Masters in CS and being a developer. My path to PM has not been direct, and I don't have an MBA.

I went from being a developer to being a Developer Advocate, to a PM. Post which I have done Sales, Marketing, Customer Success & Support roles. I believe PMs are strong generalists as technology is constantly evolving, customer needs changing and markets moving. If you want to retain Product-Market-Fit you need to keep learning.
